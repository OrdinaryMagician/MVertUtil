### MVertUtil
#### Miscellaneous vertex mesh util functions

--

This is just a small native class for providing some neat little functions to
deal with vertex meshes.

Precompiled files are provided in the repo because setting up the build
environment is a pain in the butt.

If you actually want to build this damn thing yourself, you'll need Visual C++
6.0 and the UT public headers (finding them online is really hard).
